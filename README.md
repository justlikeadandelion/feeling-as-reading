# feeling-as-reading
A website about experiencing a book as an object in the physical space.

Reading a book is more than just reading. There is touching, holding, flipping, bookmarking, scribing etc. With the intention to protect these sensorial aspects from the interaction between humans and books, flipping becomes a romantic novel, holding becomes an encyclopediaâ€¦ before they are forever lost in the flat surface of pixels..
